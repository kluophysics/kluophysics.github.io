We are focused on leveraging computational power to solve problems where electronic interactions are crucial. Due to the computational challenges posed by the complex many-body fermionic nature of electrons, these problems must be approached approximately. The chosen level of theory must balance accuracy with the feasibility of completing the task within a reasonable timeframe and resource constraints.

Our theoretical approaches span various levels of accuracy, including 
- __orbital-free density functional theory__, 
- __conventional Kohn-Sham density functional theory__, 
- __one-body reduced density matrix functional theory__, 
- __two-body density matrix functional theory__.

We work with materials composed of nearly all stable atoms from the periodic table, under a wide range of thermodynamic conditionsâ€”from absolute zero up to 1,000,000,000 Kelvin, and from 0 GPa to thousands of GPa in pressure. Each temperature requires rigorous numerical testing to ensure convergence, necessitating expertise in pseudopotentials, basis sets, and k-point grids within our group.
