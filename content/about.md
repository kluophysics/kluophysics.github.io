We are interested in using computer's capabilities to solve problem where the electronic interactions are important.
This has to be done approximately due to computational bottleneck imposed by the intricate many-body fermionic character of electrons. 
Given the accuracy of task at hand, a level of theory has to be chosen such that the task could be 
completed before some soft deadline with resonable amount of resources.

Therefore, our  theories at different level of accuracy ranges from the orbital-free density functional theory, 
conventional Kohn-Sham density functional theory, to one-body reduced density matrix functional theory, or even to 
the two-body density matrix functional theory.

The objects we are dealing with are materials built from almost all stable atoms from the periodic table. 
The range of thermodynamic conditions can be from absolute zero up to 1,000,000,000 Kelvin in temperature 
and from 0 GPa up to thousands of GPas in pressure. Each temperature requires stringent numerical testing to 
converge the calculations, so theory of pseudopotentials, basis sets, k point-grids are required in our group!
