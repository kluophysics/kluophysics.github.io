abstract = {Currently, the most common approach to calculate transport properties for materials under extreme conditions is based on the phenomenological Kubo-Greenwood method. The results of an inquiry into the justification and context of that model are summarized here. Specifically, the basis for its connection to equilibrium density functional theory (DFT) and the assumption of static ions are discussed briefly.},
